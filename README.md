The best platforms typically support at least 5-10 different cryptocurrencies, with some accepting 40+ different coins and tokens.

### How do provably fair games work?

Provably fair is a technology that allows players to verify the fairness of each game outcome. The system uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure that neither the player nor the casino can predict or manipulate the result. Before each round, the casino generates an encrypted seed, and after the round, players can verify that the outcome was determined by this pre-committed seed. This technology is unique to crypto casinos and offers unprecedented transparency.
